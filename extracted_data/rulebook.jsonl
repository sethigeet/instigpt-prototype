{"doc": "1. INTRODUCTION  \nThe B.Tech./ Dual Degree/ B.S.  programmes consist of courses in basic sciences, humanities and social \nsciences, engineering and technology and other related topics. The sequence of studies broadly consists \nof three phases.  \nThe first phase is an intense study of sciences, mathematics and humanities for deeper understanding \nof concepts than what was done in school.  \nThe second phase is the study of engineering sciences and technical arts (such as workshop, engineer-\ning graphics, etc.). This study imparts broad based knowledge in general engineering, and engineering \nmethodologies, and enables the students to appreciate the links between science and engineering. This \nphase is also, by and large, common across UG programmes, and overlaps with the first phase. \nIn the third phase, the students are exposed to subjects in their chosen areas of study, designed to train \nthem in the methodologies of analysis of problems and synthesis of solutions. The courses cover the \nprinciples governing systems and processes, and develop the ability for physical and analytical model-\ning, design and development. They are also introduced to engineering practices through laboratory \ncourses, projects, etc., and these vary from discipline to discipline. \nIn parallel with the third phase, students can strive to broaden their perspectives through atleast two \nopen Institute electives where they can take courses drawn from across the Institute.  \nB.S. programme students, in addition, work independently on a project in their last two semesters.  \nDual Degree students do additional courses to get in-depth knowledge in their chosen disciplines, often \nwith specializations. In addition, they work on a research and development project during their final \nyear. \nAt various stages of the programme, students are initiated into research methodologies, reading and \ninterpreting research papers, use of engineering and scientific equipments/ instruments, modern com-\nputational techniques, writing technical and scientific reports and effective communication. \nApart from the minimum credit requirements for the award of the degree, opportunities exist for sup-\nplementing the learning experience by crediting additional courses, in diverse areas. These additional \ncredits, when they are in focused areas, can earn the students’ credentials like Minor/ Honors. \nThe requirements for degree programmes run by the Institute are broadly classified as: \na) Institute Requirements  (further divided into Compulsory courses, Elective courses and other \nrequirements). \nb) Departmental Requirements  (further divided into Compulsory courses, Elective courses and \nother requirements). \nThe curriculum for various programmes are available on the Institute website: www.iitb.ac.in \n"}
{"doc": "1.1  Organizational Structure for Academic Administration  \nThe academic programmes of the Institute are governed by Rules and Regulations approved by the Sen-\nate from time to time. The Senate is a statutory and supreme body that governs all academic matters of \nthe Institute, and the rulings of Senate Chairperson (Director of The Institute)  are final in regard to all \n9 academic issues. A definite time schedule is set by the Senate for various academic activities, through \nan Academic Calendar issued at the beginning of each academic year.  \nThe Senate  continuously assesses the academic programmes and makes appropriate revisions/ modifi-\ncations/ improvements as and when required through two Institute level Senate sub-committees: The \nUndergraduate Programmes Committee (UGPC)  for undergraduate programmes and a Post- Graduate \nProgrammes Committee (PGPC)  for post-graduate programmes. The Dean of Academic Programmes \n(Dean, AP)  and the Associate Dean of Academic Programmes  (Associate Dean, AP)  are the Conveners \n& Co-conveners  respectively of these committees.  \nSimilarly, the performance and evaluation related issues are monitored by the Senate through two In-\nstitute level committees: Undergraduate Academic Performance Evaluation Committee (UGAPEC) and \nPostgraduate Academic Performance Evaluation Committee (PGAPEC). Conveners  for these commit-\ntees are designated from among Senate members. These four committees make recommendations to \nthe Senate and in turn seek/ receive opinions/ recommendations, when required, from the two Depart-\nment level committees in each department, the Department Undergraduate Committee (DUGC) and \nthe Department Postgraduate Committee (DPGC). The DUGCs and DPGCs handle all academic matters, \nrelated to both academic programmes as well as performance of individual student. The Head of the \nDepartment is the convener of both these departmental committees. The Senate as well as its sub-\ncommittees also have student representatives. Administrative backup for all academic matters is pro-\nvided by the Academic Office, with a Joint/ Deputy Registrar (Academic) as in-charge.  \nOn joining the Institute, each student is assigned a Faculty Adviser  from his/her Department. Students \nmust consult the Faculty Adviser on any matter relating to their academic performance and the courses \nthey may take in various semesters/ summer terms. The Faculty Adviser guides the students to com-\nplete their courses of study for the required degree in a timely manner, while maintaining good aca-\ndemic performance.  \nAll academic issues connected with the B.Tech., Dual degree, B.S. and B.Des. programmes are handled \nby DUGC, UGAPEC and UGPC. If on any academic matter a student would like to approach this adminis-\ntrative structure, it is always through the DUGC with advice and recommendations from her /his Faculty \nAdviser. \nOrganizational structure for Academic Matters  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n10 "}

Courses generally progress in sequences, \nbuilding competencies and their positioning indicates certain academic maturity on the part of \nthe students. Some courses do, in addition, specify passing in courses offered earlier in the pro-\ngrammes as pre-requisites. Students are expected to follow the semester-wise schedule of \ncourses given in the Courses of Study bulletin; they do, however, have freedom to follow alter-\nnative schedules to optimize their academic profile with additional courses, keeping the re-\nquirements for each course in mind.

{"doc": "2.5  Opportunities for Additional Learning: MINOR, HONOURS, ETC.:  \n The B.Tech./ Dual Degree/ B.S. programmes recognize the fact that students’ aspirations and \nthe demands of the work place, have become highly diverse. Every student has specific abilities, inter-\nests and career goals.  \n13 Each programme prescribes the minimum credits and courses that qualify a candidate for the award of \nthe Degree in a particular discipline. The total credits for the B.Tech. Programme, for example, vary be-\ntween 266-282 depending on the discipline, as mentioned earlier. This approximately converts itself \ninto about four theory courses and one or two laboratory courses or other activities like seminar, pro-\nject, etc., every semester.  \nThe curriculum is designed to permit B.Tech., B.S. and B.Des. students, who are not identified as aca-\ndemically weak, to optionally take additional courses. The freedom to take about six credits every se-\nmester after the first year, permits a student to satisfy her/his interests / abilities and aspirations. \nIt is expected that all students with reasonably good academic standing, utilize this surplus time for en-\nhancing their academic learning experience, though the initiative is left entirely to them. They can use it \nto credit an assortment of courses/projects anywhere in the Institute, (subject to requirements of each \nof these courses being met), to gain a wide exposure. These additional academic accomplishments will \nfind a separate mention in the transcript (refer Sec.6.8.4) . They can also credit courses in specific areas \nwhich can qualify as a minor/ honours. They may alternatively devote part or all of the additional time \nfor extra- curricular activities (including social work) if they so desire, and gain hands-on administrative/ \nmanagerial/ aesthetic skills or sensitivity towards social issues. \nSince seats available in such additional courses are often limited and the competition severe, students \naspiring to do these additional courses have to maintain high academic standing to register in these \ncourses.   \n"}

S/he \naccumulates credits by registering for the required courses, and if the requirements for a particular mi-\nnor are met within the prescribed minimum time limit for the programme, the minor will be awarded. \nThis will be mentioned in the Degree Certificate as “Bachelor of Technology in xxx with Minor in yyy.” \nThis will also be reflected in the transcript, along with the list of courses taken. \nSince the number of seats available for each of the courses are often limited, one has to compete for a \nplace in every course. If 30 credits are not completed for Minor then Minor will not be awarded . The \nindividual course credits earned, however, will be reflected in the transcript. \nFor the award of the minor, all requirements towards the basic degree and the minor have to be com-\npleted within the stipulated period of the programme one is registered for. \nThe Senate in its 224th meeting approved the proposal of allowing Dual Degree students to undertake \nminor courses.

Fee is not refundable. \nd) Re-exam is permitted on the same terms and conditions like that of regular semester courses.    \ne) Time slots will be assigned by or communicated to the Academic Office like that of regular se-\nmester courses. \nf) A student can take up to a maximum of 24 credits of Mandatory Courses (Core + HSS + Depart-\nment & Institute Electives) in which s/he has received FR/DX/DR/W grade.  However, if a stu-\ndent accumulates two (or more) “FR” in Mandatory   Courses   and   does   not   find   enough \ncourses   (totaling   up   to 24 credits)   in   a   summer   term,   s/he can   take   a   maximum   of   \ntwo Mandatory Courses in which s/he has NEVER registered.

{"doc": "6.8.2    Cumulative Performance Index (CPI)  \nAn up to date assessment of the overall performance of a student from the time s/he entered the Insti-\ntute is obtained by calculating a number called the Cumulative Performance Index, CPI, in a manner \nsimilar to the calculation of SPI. The CPI therefore considers all the courses registered by the student, \ntowards the minimum requirement of the degree s/he has enrolled for, since s/he entered the Insti-\ntute. The CPI is calculated at the end of every semester to two decimal places. \nThe CPI will reflect the failed status in case of FR grade(s), till the course(s) is/are cleared.  \nWhen the course(s) is/are cleared by obtaining a pass grade on subsequent registration(s) the CPI will \nonly reflect the new grade and not the fail grades earned earlier. \nExample: Up to semester r a student has registered for n courses, among which s/he has a “FR” grade in \ncourse i. The semester grade report at the end of semester r therefore will contain a CPI calculated as: \nC1g1 + C2 g2 + C3 g3 + .. +Ci* ZERO+Cn gn \nCPI =  ------------------------------------------------------------------------- \nC1 + C2 + C3 + ... +Ci + ... + Cn \nEven if a student has failed in a course more than once, the course will figure only once in the numera-\ntor as well as the denominator. \nAt the end of semester r+1 s/he has registered for four more courses including the backlog course i and \nhas cleared all the courses including the backlog course, the CPI at the end of this semester is calculated \nas: \n31  C1g1 + C2 g2 + C3 g3 + .. +Ci*gi+..+Cn gn \nCPI =  -------------------------------------------------------------------- \n C1 + C2 + C3 + ... +Ci + ... + Cn \nThe courses which do not form the minimum requirement of the degrees will not be considered for cal-\nculation of the basic CPI.

{"doc": "251st   Senate Meeting) : \nAddition of course equivalence for core courses will be permitted on approval of DUGC of respective \nAcademic Units. \n2.3.3 Seminars  \nSome departments prescribe a Seminar as a requirement for B.Tech./ B.S./ B.Des. or the Dual Degree. A \nSeminar is a course wherein under the guidance of a faculty member a student is expected to do an in-\ndepth study in a specialized area by doing a survey of published technical literature and understand dif-\nferent aspects of the problem. Finally, the results from literature must be summarized in a written re-\nport and presented before a designated committee of faculty members. Seminars typically carry 3 \ncredits. \n2.3.4 Projects  \n2.3.4.1 B.Tech. Projects (BTP - I and BTP – II)  \nSome departments prescribe Project as a requirement for the B.Tech. degree, or as a requirement for \nHonors (refer Sec.2.5.2), wherein under the guidance of a faculty member a student, in the sixth semes-\nter or later, is required to do innovative work with the application of knowledge gained from courses in \nthe earlier years. The student is expected to do a survey of literature in the subject, work out a project \nplan and carry it out through design, analysis, experimentation etc. These projects (BTPs) may be of-\nfered as a single unit of 12 credits (BTP) or as 6 credits of BTP-I followed by BTP-II of 6 credits or 12 \ncredits.  (Ref: 241st   Senate Meeting)  \nEven when it is not prescribed as a minimum requirement for the degree or when not being interested \nin Honours, a student can opt to do a BTP as additional learning, if s/he can find suitable supervisor (s) \nto guide her/him. \n2.3.4.2 B.S. Project (Ref: 240th Senate Meeting)  \n Some departments prescribe a B.S. Project as a requirement for the B.S. degree. Such a project \nis carried out under the guidelines of a faculty member and may carry 6 or more credits as prescribed \nby the department. \n2.3.4.3 Dual Degree Project (DDP)  \nThe Dual Degree Project is a mandatory requirement of the Dual Degree Programmes. The project con-\nsists of two stages, spread over fourteen months, normally starting from the summer after the eighth \nsemester and ending with the summer after the tenth semester. These are essentially research and de-\nvelopment projects, where a student trains under the guidance of supervisor/ s, in-depth analysis of an \nengineering problem and attempts synthesis of a solution. Literature survey, problem analysis and \nproblem definition, extensive experimental/ modeling/ computational work and analysis of results \n12 typically form various components of the project work. A DDP (B.Tech.-M.Tech.) carries a total of 72 \ncredits. \n2.3.4 Non-Credit Requirements  \n2.3.4.1 NCC / NSO / NSS  \nOne of the three activities, National Cadet Corps (NCC) or National Sports Organization (NSO) or Na-\ntional Service Scheme  (NSS) is a mandatory requirement for all students for the award of a degree. \nThese are normally conducted during evenings of week days and are designed to build character and to \nsensitize the students to social/ national issues. These activities carry no credits and are evaluated as \nPass (PP)/ Not Pass (NP) . \n \n2.4 Minimum Credit Requirements and Planning of Individual Academic Programme (Ref: 233rd \n Senate Meeting)  \nDepending on the discipline, the minimum credits required for the award of a B.Tech. / B.S. / B.Des. \ndegree are between 266 and 282  (though the department component can be differently designed by \nthe departments). \nThis is nominally divided into Basic Sciences (60 to 62), Engineering Sciences & skills (30), HSS Electives \n(12), Institute Electives (12), Departmental courses (152 to 168). \nThe \"B.Tech. + M.Tech. Dual Degree programme\"  should have all of the following components over \nand above the corresponding basic B.Tech. curriculum: \na) B.Tech honors credit a minimum of 24 credits that can comprise of either only courses or a \ncombination of courses and a  Project. The Project duration can be of two semesters with a \nmaximum of 18 credits. \nb) 24 credits consisting of four masters level courses. \nc) 72 credits of a masters' thesis spread over 14 months (e.g. summer between eighth and ninth \nsemester, plus ninth and tenth semesters).The credits are distributed semester-wise as shown \nin the Courses of Study bulletin for each department. Courses generally progress in sequences, \nbuilding competencies and their positioning indicates certain academic maturity on the part of \nthe students. Some courses do, in addition, specify passing in courses offered earlier in the pro-\ngrammes as pre-requisites. Students are expected to follow the semester-wise schedule of \ncourses given in the Courses of Study bulletin; they do, however, have freedom to follow alter-\nnative schedules to optimize their academic profile with additional courses, keeping the re-\nquirements for each course in mind. For students who may have dropped mandatory courses, \nsuch rescheduling may even become necessary. Such departures from suggested schedules \nneed to be done very carefully, and always with approval of the Faculty Adviser. \n2.5  Opportunities for Additional Learning: MINOR, HONOURS, ETC.:  \n The B.Tech./ Dual Degree/ B.S. programmes recognize the fact that students’ aspirations and \nthe demands of the work place, have become highly diverse. Every student has specific abilities, inter-\nests and career goals.  \n13 Each programme prescribes the minimum credits and courses that qualify a candidate for the award of \nthe Degree in a particular discipline. The total credits for the B.Tech. Programme, for example, vary be-\ntween 266-282 depending on the discipline, as mentioned earlier. This approximately converts itself \ninto about four theory courses and one or two laboratory courses or other activities like seminar, pro-\nject, etc., every semester.  \nThe curriculum is designed to permit B.Tech., B.S. and B.Des. students, who are not identified as aca-\ndemically weak, to optionally take additional courses. The freedom to take about six credits every se-\nmester after the first year, permits a student to satisfy her/his interests / abilities and aspirations. \nIt is expected that all students with reasonably good academic standing, utilize this surplus time for en-\nhancing their academic learning experience, though the initiative is left entirely to them. They can use it \nto credit an assortment of courses/projects anywhere in the Institute, (subject to requirements of each \nof these courses being met), to gain a wide exposure. These additional academic accomplishments will \nfind a separate mention in the transcript (refer Sec.6.8.4) . They can also credit courses in specific areas \nwhich can qualify as a minor/ honours. They may alternatively devote part or all of the additional time \nfor extra- curricular activities (including social work) if they so desire, and gain hands-on administrative/ \nmanagerial/ aesthetic skills or sensitivity towards social issues. \nSince seats available in such additional courses are often limited and the competition severe, students \naspiring to do these additional courses have to maintain high academic standing to register in these \ncourses.   \n2.5.1 Minor  \nMinor is an additional credential a student may earn if s/he does 30 credits worth of additional courses \nin a discipline other than her/his major discipline of B.Tech. degree. All academic units in the Institute \noffer minors in their disciplines, and will prescribe a specific set of courses and/or projects necessary for \nearning a minor in that discipline. \nA student must pre-register for a minor course which is finally allotted on the basis of highest CPI. S/he \naccumulates credits by registering for the required courses, and if the requirements for a particular mi-\nnor are met within the prescribed minimum time limit for the programme, the minor will be awarded. \nThis will be mentioned in the Degree Certificate as “Bachelor of Technology in xxx with Minor in yyy.” \nThis will also be reflected in the transcript, along with the list of courses taken. \nSince the number of seats available for each of the courses are often limited, one has to compete for a \nplace in every course. If 30 credits are not completed for Minor then Minor will not be awarded . The \nindividual course credits earned, however, will be reflected in the transcript. \nFor the award of the minor, all requirements towards the basic degree and the minor have to be com-\npleted within the stipulated period of the programme one is registered for. \nThe Senate in its 224th meeting approved the proposal of allowing Dual Degree students to undertake \nminor courses. These rules were further modified in the 236th meeting of the Senate.  \nDD students of category I and II can register for minor courses from 2nd year onwards. These students \nare allowed to take additional courses (within permissible credit limit) in their 9th   and 10th Semesters, \nif needed to complete the minor requirement. (Ref: 239th Senate Meeting) \n \n14 2.5.2 Honours  \nHonours is an additional credential a student may earn if s/he opts for the extra 24 credits needed for \nthis in her/his own discipline. The concerned department specifies the set of courses for earning Hon-\nours. Honours is not indicative of class. \nStudents can accumulate credits by registering for Honours courses prescribed by the department. On \nsuccessful accumulation of 24 credits at the end of the programme, this will be mentioned in the De-\ngree Certificate as “Bachelor of Technology in xxx, with Honours.” This will also be reflected in the tran-\nscript, along with the list of courses taken. \nFor the award of the honours to B.Tech. students, all requirements towards the basic degree and the \nhonours have to be completed within the stipulated period of the programme one is registered for. \nDual degrees of B.Tech. and M.Tech. intrinsically demand a deeper expertise in the major discipline of \nthe student, and therefore Dual Degree students are required to complete the requirements for Hon-\nours, as prescribed by the department. The requirements for Honours for a Dual Degree student may \nbe different from those prescribed for a B.Tech. student. This requirement is over and above the basic \nrequirements for the B.Tech. degrees as prescribed by each department. The total credit requirement is \ntherefore 266-282 (B.Tech.) + 24 (Honours) + 72 (Project) + 24 (Masters courses). \n2.5.3 Two Minors etc. for Students  \nStudents in Category I, can opt for earning an additional minor (i.e. an Honour and a minor, OR if time \ntable permits, two minors). Students should discuss this with their faculty advisers since completing \ntwo minors would involve significant overload. \n \n3. ROLE OF THE FACULTY ADVISER  \nOn joining the Institute, a student or a group of students is/are assigned to a Faculty Adviser. The stu-\ndents are expected to consult the Faculty Adviser on any matter relating to their academic performance \nand the courses they may take in various semesters. The Faculty Adviser guides the students to com-\nplete their courses of study for the required degree. For effective utilization of the opportunities for ad-\nditional academic accomplishments, the planning of an individual’s academic journey needs careful \nconsideration, and hence constant consultation with the Faculty Advisers are imperative. The Faculty \nAdviser is the person whom the parents/ guardians should contact for performance related issues of \ntheir wards.  \n The role of the Faculty Adviser is outlined below:  \ni. Guide the students about the rules and regulations governing the courses of study. \nii. Advise the students to register for courses as per the curriculum and their academic standing. \niii. Approve the registration of the students.  \niv. Pay special attention to weak students and carefully monitor the performance of students rec-\nommended for the slow track option. \nv. Advice students on Course Adjustment / Drop during the Semester within the stipulated time \nframe given in the Academic calendar. \n15 vi. Advice students seeking a semester drop about rules and regulations laid down for this pur-\npose and recommend these cases to the UGAPEC through the DUGC, for consideration. \nvii. Consider and recommend to the DUGC, applications for course/ credit requirements for the \nstudents for exchange programmes. In addition, the faculty adviser converts the grades from \nthe foreign institute to IIT Bombay as per senate approved rules. \nviii. To ensure that students are not permitted to re-register for courses, which they have already \npassed. \nix. Inform students that grades will not be awarded for any academic activity (course/ Lab./ semi-\nnar/ project/ non credit requirement etc.) without approved registration.  \nx. Strictly warn students that if s/he fails to register during any semester without prior approval, \nhis/her studentship is liable to be cancelled. \n \n4.  REGISTRATION  \n Registration at the beginning of each semester, as per the prescribed dates announced in the \nAcademic Calendar, is mandatory for every student till s/he completes her/ his programme. If a student \ndoes not register in a particular semester without prior permission of the UGAPEC, her/his studentship \nis liable to be cancelled . Students are not permitted to re-register for course/(s), which they have al-\nready passed. All students’ registration have to be approved by his/ her faculty Adviser.  Some courses \nmay also require instructor consent. \n4.1 Semester-Wise registration  \n On joining the Institute, each student is assigned to a Faculty Adviser or an Advisory group (re-\nfer Sec.3). The student can register for courses s/he intends to take during a given semester or summer \nterm on the basis of the programme for each discipline as given in the Curriculum and as per the advice \ngiven by his/her Faculty Adviser. The Faculty Adviser is expected to discuss with the student his/her ac-\nademic performance during the previous semester and then decide the number and nature of the \ncourses for which s/he can register during the semester within the framework of the guidelines as ap-\nproved by the Senate. The Faculty Adviser may advise the student to drop one or more courses/ activi-\nties based on his/her academic performance (refer Sec. 5.1). In fact, the Faculty Adviser may even ad-\nvise a reduced load programme over several semesters for students with poor performance at the end \nof the first semester/ year. \n4.2 Procedure for Registrations  \nThe Institute has an online registration system and the registration is normally done on the first two \ndays of each semester. The registration schedule is announced in the Academic Calendar. In all circum-\nstances, registration must be completed on or before the prescribed last date for registration. Students \nhaving outstanding dues to the Institute or a hostel shall not be permitted to register. \n4.2.1 Online Registration  \nThe online registration process involves filling up of an online Course Registration Form (CRF) stating \nthe courses and project / seminar etc., that the student proposes to complete during that semester as \nper the prescribed curriculum. This should be done in consultation with the Faculty Adviser, who finally \n16 approves the registration as per permissible load (refer Sec. 5.2). Grades will not be awarded for any \nacademic activity (course/ Lab./ seminar/ project/ non credit requirement etc.) without approved \nregistration.  \n4.2.2 Late Registration  \nOnly for valid reasons, late registration may be permitted till the date specified in the Academic Calen-\ndar, on payment of a late registration fee. \n4.2.3 Registration for the first two semesters (except B.Des.)  \nIn each of the first two semesters, courses common to all branches are generally offered. A student is \nnormally required to register for all the courses listed in the curriculum for these two semesters. Stu-\ndents, who are identified as academically weak at the end of first semester, may be prescribed a re-\nduced load  (refer Sec. 10). \n4.2.4 Registration for third and subsequent semesters  \nThe prescribed credits per semester is given in the course bulletin of the respective academic units. \nFrom the third semester onwards, registration is dependent on the academic standing of the student. A \nstudent with an academic standing of Category I, II, III and IV may register for additional courses over \nand above the prescribed credits in the course bulletin with the approval of Faculty Adviser subject to \nSection 5.2.  \n4.3 Registration for Institute Elective Courses:  \nAn Institute Elective course can be any credit course across the Institute provided that: \na. It should not be from the Academic Unit in which the student is registered. \nb. It should not be ‘Core’ or ‘Department Elective’ course in the curriculum on the programme in which \nthe student is registered. \nAn Institute Elective course should be registered in consultation of Faculty Advisor. \n4. 4 Registration for Non-credit courses (NCC/ NSO / NSS)  \nNon-credit requirements are assessed as Pass (PP)/ Not Pass (NP) subject to the fulfillment of the mini-\nmum requirements of these activities and a minimum of 80% attendance.  One of NCC, NSO or NSS, is a \nmandatory requirement for the award of degree. Students are expected to complete these require-\nments during the first year (first two semesters). Formal registration for any one of these activities must \nbe done along with other courses, at the beginning in the first two semesters. The choice of the activity \nwill be done on the basis of the aptitude of the student for any one of these activities and will be de-\ncided by a committee constituted for the purpose. Once registered for one of these activities, no \nchange will be permitted at a later stage. \nIn addition to the above mandatory requirements, the students are permitted to take NSS/NSO/NCC in \nsubsequent years too, if they have special interest. This will be mentioned in the transcript (refer \nSec.6.8.4) \n \n \n17 4.5 Registration for Projects  \n4.5.1 Registration for B.Tech. Projects (BTPs)  \nRegistration for B.Tech. Projects (BTPs) as specified in the curriculum, is similar to that for any other \ncourse. The details of allotment of topics, faculty supervisors etc. are specified by the concerned de-\npartment before the commencement of the semester. \n4.5.2 Registration for Dual Degree Projects (DDPs)  \ni. The total duration for the DDP is fourteen months. DDP consists of two stages. Credits for \nStage I are 30-36 and for stage II are 36 to 42. The information about project registration, \npresentation/ submission/ assessment and submission of grades is given below: \nProject Stage  Registration Submission/Presentation/Assessment to be \ncompleted during the following period Submission of \nGrades to the Aca-\ndemic Office on or \nbefore \nStage I Registration for stage \nI will be done in Jan-\nuary (8th Semester)– \nAs per academic cal-\nendar  By October Month (9th Semester)– As per \nacademic calendar October/ Novem-\nber of the same \nyear (9th Semes-\nter)– As per aca-\ndemic calendar \n(Final) Stage II  Registration for stage \nII will be carried out \nalong with the grade \nreport for the stage I   \n– As per academic \ncalendar By June Month (Just after 10th Semester) – \nAs per academic calendar July of the same \nyear (Just after \n10th Semester)– As \nper academic cal-\nendar \nii. Each Dual Degree student should have a member of the faculty as a supervisor. In addition, Co-\nsupervisor/(s) from the same Department/ other Department / IDP Group/Centre / School may \nbe co-opted by the supervisor with the approval of the DUGC. If the supervisor is not from the \nsame department as the student, a co-supervisor from the Department is necessary. \niii. Whenever a supervisor leaves the Institute permanently/ temporarily, the DUGC shall make \nalternative arrangements for guidance during the supervisor’s absence. \nRequirements for the DDP and the evaluation procedures are given in (refer Sec. 6.4.2) \n4.5.3    Registration for B.S. Project (Ref: 240th Senate Meeting)  \nRegistration for B.S. Projects as specified in the curriculum, is similar to that for any other course. The \ndetails of allotment of topics, faculty supervisors etc. are specified by the concerned department before \nthe commencement of the semester.  \n4.6 Course Adjustment/ Dropping of courses  \na) The Academic Calendar sets a date, typically one week after the commencement of the semes-\nter, for Course Adjustment. On or before this date, a student is permitted to make adjustments \n18 in her/his academic load by addition or deletion of one or more courses, projects etc., provided \nthe total credits do not exceed the bounds (refer Sec. 5.2). Course adjustment has to be done \nin consultation with the Faculty Adviser. \nb) If in the second or any of the subsequent semesters, a student finds her/his academic load too \nheavy, s/he may drop some courses in consultation with the Faculty Adviser, provided the min-\nimum credit requirements ( 18 credits ) are fulfilled.  The last date for such drops is typically 20-\n30 days after the end of the mid-semester examination, and is set in the Academic Calendar. It \nis expected that the results of the mid-semester examination will be known within seven days \nof the end of the examination. \n \n4.7 Dropping of a Semester:  \na) A student may opt/be advised to drop an entire semester, with prior approval of DUGC/UGAPEC \ndue to the following reasons: \ni. During a registered semester, if a student finds that s/he is unable to cope up with the stud-\nies and/or does not have sufficient exposure to most of the courses registered in that se-\nmester due to severe health problem or some other valid reasons beyond her/his control, \ns/he can opt to drop the entire semester, in consultation with the Faculty Adviser and with \npermission from the DUGC/UGAPEC. \nii. A student may seek a semester drop, due to severe personal health problem, unavoidable \nfamily commitments or other valid reasons beyond her/his control, in consultation with \nthe Faculty Adviser and with permission from the DUGC/UGAPEC, prior to the commence-\nment of the semester itself. \nb) In all cases of severe health problems, medical certificate issued by IIT Hospital is essential. If \nhowever, the medical certificate is issued by other hospitals/private practitioners, the certifi-\ncates should be duly authenticated by the CMO, IIT Hospital. In all other cases, requests for \ndropping the semester should be accompanied by supporting documents as required. \nc) A student will be not permitted to drop a semester after the award of DX/ II grade/(s) and/ or \nsemester end examination. \nd) Such breaks from studies is typically not permitted for a continuous period in excess of one \nyear. \ne) Not registering for any semester before the last date for registration without prior approval of \nthe UGAPEC may result in the UGAPEC recommending dropping that semester. (Ref: 240th  Sen-\nate meeting)  \nf) Hostel accommodation and other institutional facilities will not be extended in any semester \nfor which the student has not registered. \n4.8 Registration for Additional Courses (Minor, Honors etc.): (Ref.- 236th Senate Meeting)  \nAny student may register for minor or honors courses subject to satisfying the pre-requisites for the re-\nspective courses. The number of students permitted for Minor courses is to be specified before the \n19 registration date by the department, and the allocation is done on the basis of  CPI . Students are per-\nmitted to register for Minor courses only during the pre- registration period . \nNote that there is no specific registration for Honours Courses. One accumulates the required credits \nduring the course of the programme and the additional credential is awarded if the criteria set for them \nare met when the student graduates. \nIn any semester, a student must register for at least one course component that is specified as the mini-\nmum requirement of the degree. Moreover, a student cannot overstay in the programme once the \nminimum requirements prescribed for the basic degree are completed. \n4.9 Summer term Course Registration  \n Running of courses in summer term and registration of students to these courses must follow \nthe guidelines mentioned below:                                   \na) The  course  instructor/(s) should  be  willing to  offer  the  course.  The DUGC should recom-\nmend   offering   of   such   a   summer   course   for consideration and   approval   of   the   \nDean   of Academic Programmes. The course is offered on approval of the Dean of Academic \nProgrammes. \nb) The course should be offered with adequate rigor and in the same manner as a regular semes-\nter course is offered.  The registration, examination and assessment, course duration and grad-\ning should adhere to the timelines in academic calendar. The total number of contact hours for \nthe courses remains the same as that during the regular semesters, and therefore, the courses \nrun at accelerated pace (for example 6 hours of instructions per week is expected for a 3-0-0 \ncourse) the Academic Calendar in this connection is strictly followed. \nc) The dropping of a Summer Course is permitted within 7 days from the first lecture of the \ncourse.  Fee is not refundable. \nd) Re-exam is permitted on the same terms and conditions like that of regular semester courses.    \ne) Time slots will be assigned by or communicated to the Academic Office like that of regular se-\nmester courses. \nf) A student can take up to a maximum of 24 credits of Mandatory Courses (Core + HSS + Depart-\nment & Institute Electives) in which s/he has received FR/DX/DR/W grade.  However, if a stu-\ndent accumulates two (or more) “FR” in Mandatory   Courses   and   does   not   find   enough \ncourses   (totaling   up   to 24 credits)   in   a   summer   term,   s/he can   take   a   maximum   of   \ntwo Mandatory Courses in which s/he has NEVER registered. (Ref: 239th Senate Meeting - ef-\nfective from Summer term 2019-20).  \ng) Courses   requiring   pre-requisites   need   instructor’s   approval   in case   the student has not \ncompleted the pre-requisites. (Ref: 239th Senate Meeting - effective from Summer term 2019-\n20). \nh) NO   restrictions (i.e. #f) will   apply   after   the   expiry   of   the regular programme duration (4 \nyears for B.Tech, B.Des. and B.S., 5 years for DD). (Ref:239th Senate Meeting  - effective from \nSummer term 2019-20).  \n20 i) At   least   05   students   should   register   for   the   summer   course. The attendance   record   \nshould   be maintained and the minimum of 80% attendance is compulsory.  The Instructors \nmay award a “FR” grade to students who fail to adhere to 80% attendance for the summer \ncourse. \nj) Courses offered in a summer term will be treated as equivalent to regular semester courses for \nall accounting purposes. \n \n5.   SPECIAL FEATURES IN REGISTRATION  \nThe curriculum has special features that a student must be aware of while registering for courses. \nThese include institute core courses, department core and elective courses, non-departmental courses, \nminor and honours options. Registration for courses depend on the academic standing of the student, \nas explained in this section. The registration for backlog courses and audit courses are also explained in \nthis section. \n5.1 Academic Standing (Ref: 236th Senate Meeting)  \nDepending on the overall academic performance of a student till date, especially in the two preceding \nregular semesters (Autumn and Spring) in which the student had registered, the academic standing of \nthe student is decided. A NP (not passed) grade is not counted towards failed courses in the context of \ndetermining the academic standing).  \nCategorization of the academic standing of a student is as follows: \nCategory I :  A student who has CPI at least 8, and no outstanding FR/DX/DR/W grade in a core course. \nCategory II : CPI less than 8, and no outstanding FR/DX/DR/W grade in a core course.   \nCategory III (Ref: 241st Senate Meeting) : A student who has at least one outstanding FR/DX/DR/W in \ncore courses and at most one  FR or DX grade in any other course in two preceding regular registered \nsemesters, subject to having earned at least 18 credits in each of the semesters. These 18 credits may \nbe earned in courses with any TAG. \nCategory IV (Ref: 241st Senate Meeting) : A student who has at least one outstanding FR/DX/DR/W in \ncore courses and more than one  FR or DX grade in any other course in two preceding regular registered \nsemesters, subject to having earned at least 18 credits in each of the semesters. These 18 credits may \nbe earned in courses with any TAG. \nCategory V: A student who has not earned at least 18 credits (in courses with any TAG) in at least one \nof the previous two regular registered semesters. \nCategory VI (ARP):  Students who have accumulated FRs/DXs worth 36 credits in core courses.  \nNote:  \na) Category VI supersedes all other categories. \nb) Students having at most 54 credits left to graduate may register for upto 54 credits on \nrecommendation of the Faculty Adviser/ PIC(ARP) (Ref: 236th Senate Meeting)  \n21 In such cases where students have returned from semester exchange and the grades are not updated \ntill the time of registration, the performance in the last two completed semesters at IIT Bombay may be \nconsidered for the purpose of CPI and Academic Category calculation. The same rule is also applicable \nin cases of semester drop. (Ref:237th Senate Meeting)  \nInterim Categories of the students are calculated using the information available 24 hours before regis-\ntration for the new semester begins. These categories are used for the purpose of registration for the \nnew semester. (Ref:248th Senate Meeting)  \n5.2 Permissible Registration Load (Ref: 235th Senate meeting)  \nStudents are allowed to register as per their academic standing subject to a maximum credit limit as \ngiven below: \nAcademic Standing  Maximum Credits Allowed  \nCategory I  54 credits  \nCategory II, III, IV  48 credits  \nCategory V  30 credits  \nCategory VI (ARP)  24 credits  \nThe Faculty Adviser is the competent authority to approve course registration in all cases. \nEvery student must register for a minimum of 18 credits each semester. In case a student has com-\npleted most of the minimum credit requirements, she/he may register for the remaining courses which \nare available in that semester, which may be less than 18 credits. \nThe maximum credits allowed as given above cannot be exceeded under any circumstances. While \nthese are the maximum allowed credits the Faculty Adviser may prescribe lower credits especially for \nCategory III, IV, V and VI. \nThe Dual Degree project credits will not be counted in case of permissible load. (Ref: \n241st   Senate Meeting)  \nThe current limits on credits (as per the academic category) for registration purposes are applicable \nonly for students who have not yet completed the regular duration of programme for their degree, be-\nyond which the above restriction is waived. (w.e.f. Spring Semester 2020-21) \n5.3 Carrying backlogs forward  \nAttempts are made in the programme to give an early opportunity to register again for courses in which \nstudents may have received FR/ W/ DR/ DX grade.  \na The Institute core courses are expected to be offered in both the semesters, so that a \nstudent can register for a backlog course in the immediate next semester.  \nb For department core courses that are not possible to be offered in both semesters, the \nFaculty Adviser may advise the students appropriately for dropping the backlog course \nin favor of some other course in order to avoid a cascading effect in subsequent \n22 semesters. The Faculty Advisers and DUGCs would exercise special care and assist the \nstudents in this regard. \nc Students should give priority to clear core courses that are pre-requisites for other \ncourses in subsequent semesters.  \n5.4 Audit Course  \nA student wanting just an exposure to a course, without the rigors of obtaining a letter grade, can regis-\nter a course in 'Audit' mode. A course can be audited provided the course is offered in the semester as \na credit course for others, and there is no slot clash. Prior permission of the Instructor is required. \nTo complete a course in 'Audit' mode, the student has to fulfil the requirement as set by the course in-\nstructor, such as submission of assignments and minimum performances in in-semester evaluations. A \ncourse, successfully completed in 'Audit' mode, cannot be considered towards the requirement of Mi-\nnor or Honors. \nA student, on successful completion of the requirements of a course in 'Audit' mode, will be eligible for \na 'AU' grade. The 'AU' grade carries zero grade point and is not included in SPI/CPI calculations. The 'AU' \ngrade will be shown in the Transcript. \nIn case a student fails to complete the requirements of a course, registered in 'Audit' mode, instructor \nwill not assign any grade and the student will be de-registered from the course. The same will be de-\nleted from the student's registration, as it will be assumed that the course has been dropped by that \nstudent. \nFor the entire duration of the programme, a UG student can audit maximum TWO courses. \nUG students, who are only in Category I and II, will be permitted to 'Audit' a course during a regular se-\nmester. \n5.5 Registration for Postgraduate level courses (Ref: 235th Senate Meeting)  \nUndergraduate students may be permitted to register for some postgraduate level courses from fifth \nsemester onwards with permission of the instructor and approval of the Faculty Adviser without any \nrestrictions. \n \n5.6 Guided Study: (Ref: 240th Senate Meeting)  \nGuided Study is doing courses outside the curriculum in the self-study like mode, during a regular se-\nmester. A student belonging to category I may be provided the option of Guided study to acquire profi-\nciency in an area of his/her choice, on recommendation of the Faculty Adviser/ project guide, DUGC \nand approval of UGAPEC . Guided Study will be available to the extent of a maximum of one course per \nsemester with effect from the third semester, subject to a maximum of four courses in the entire pro-\ngramme. This option is strictly subject to the availability and willingness of the instructor offering the \ncourse. Guided Study and URA (refer Sec. 9) will not run concurrently, and the rules that govern permis-\nsible registration load apply strictly even for these courses. These courses can be considered towards \nMinor/ Honors, if so specified by the concerned academic unit. Registration, Examination/ Evaluation \nand submission of grade etc. in case of guided study will also be governed in the similar way as other \ncourses of the curriculum. \n23 The option of guided study may also be made available, by the UGAPEC, in the following situation, on a \ncase-by-case basis: \nStudents who miss the ‘Departmental Introductory Course’ due to a change of branch obtained at the \nend of First year. \n5.7 Self-Study (Ref: 236th Senate Meeting)  \nStudents can take upto two courses as self-study, after the expiry of the regular programme duration (4 \nyears for B.Tech, B.Des, B.S. Programs, 5 years for Dual Degree) after taking necessary approval.  This \noption is only available for completing the mandatory credits. \nHowever, for the self-study option, the following directives will be followed: - \na) The registration, examination etc. will be as per academic calendar. The evaluation for self-\nstudy will be done in the similar way as is done for normal semester course. \nb) Academic standards be rigorously maintained in the self-study mode.  \n5.8 Course Substitution  \nIn case a student obtains FR/DX grades or drops courses due to valid reason, s/he may like to sub-\nstitute courses in order to complete the requirements within the stipulated duration. Following is the \nguideline for course substitution. \na) Course substitution is not permitted for Core Courses, may it be an institute core course or de-\npartmental core course. The student has to re-register the same course and complete them. \nb) An Institute elective course may be substituted by another Institute elective course from the \nsame group. \nc) A departmental elective course may be substituted by another departmental elective course \nfrom the same group \n \n6 EXAMINATION / ASSESSMENT  \nSemester wise performance assessment of every registered student is done through various modes of \nexaminations. These include quizzes, class tests, home assignments, group assignments, viva-voce, mid-\nsemester examination and semester-end examination. The Instructor will announce the modes of eval-\nuation and distribution of weightage for each of the assessments at the beginning of the course. \nVarious modes of assessment for theory and laboratory courses along with the recommended relative \nweightage of various components are given in this section. A large departure from the recommended \nmodes of assessments and weightage will require prior approval from the Dean of Academic Pro-\ngrammes. \n \n6.1 Modes of Evaluation for Theory Courses  \na) Various modes of assessment used for rating students’ performance in a theory course include \nquizzes, class tests, home assignments, group assignments, viva-voce, mid-semester and se-\nmester-end examinations. Relative weightage for in-semester evaluations is typically between \n24 50 and 60 per cent. This will consist of one mid-semester exam of two hours duration, of about \n25-30 per cent weightage, to be held as per the schedule fixed in the Academic Calendar. Two \nquizzes or one quiz and one test  along with assignments and viva-voce shall make up the rest of \nthe in-semester assessment or as declared by the course instructor at the beginning of the se-\nmester The Instructor may also set aside up to a maximum of 20 per cent of the in-semester \nmarks for attendance and/or class participation. (Ref: 235th Senate Meeting)  Make-up for any \nabsence from in-semester evaluations like midsem/tests/quizzes will be at the discretion of the \nInstructor. \nb)  The semester end examination will be held as per the Academic Calendar and the weightage \nfor this would be typically 40 to 50 per cent. It is typically of 3 hours duration and covers the \nfull syllabus of the course. The semester- end examination is mandatory. The instructor awards \nan “II” grade for those students not appearing for the Semester end examination, if they have \nnot been awarded a DX grade for insufficient attendance. Such students are eligible for a se-\nmester-end re-examination only on medical grounds/ valid reasons (refer Sec. 6.6) and on pro-\nduction of medical certificate or other supporting documents as the case requires. The applica-\ntion must be submitted to Instructor concerned before the start date of re-exam and online \ngrading window announced in the Academic Calendar. Instructors are expected to conduct the \nre-exam and upload the grade as per academic calendar.  \nc) If a student fails to appear for the re-examination too, the instructor will award “FR” grade \nagain. If the absence in the re exam is due to medical / valid reasons, the student must submit \nsupporting documents as mentioned above, within seven days of the scheduled date of the re-\nexam, to the Academic Office. UGAPEC will examine such cases and convert the “II” grade into \na dropped course status (“DR”). In all other cases the “II” grade will be converted to “FR” \ngrade. In any case the “II” grade will not be continued beyond the commencement of the sub-\nsequent semester. \n \n6.2 Modes of Evaluation for Laboratory Courses  \nThe assessment in a laboratory course will be based on turn-to-turn supervision of the student’s work, \nher/his performance in viva-voce examinations and group discussions, the quality of their work as pre-\nscribed through laboratory journals and a semester-end test that contains an experiment or a written \nexamination. In-semester work will typically carry 75% and the semester-end test 25% weightage re-\nspectively. It is obligatory to maintain a laboratory journal as prescribed by the course instructor. The \nfinal examination for laboratory courses will typically be held a week before the final theory examina-\ntions. In case of absence from semester-end examination, the same rules as those for theory courses is \napplicable. \n6.3 Modes of Evaluation for Seminars  \nSeminars are evaluated based on a written report and an oral presentation before a panel of examiners \nappointed by the DUGC/ coordinator. The supervisor /co-supervisor, when involved, are part of the \npanel. Grades carrying grade points are awarded as in the case of theory and laboratory courses based \non the quality of the report and performance in the presentation. The evaluation of the seminars is \ncompleted and the grades submitted to the academic office (one week) before the commencement of \nthe end- semester examination. \n25 6.4 Modes of Evaluation for Projects  \nAs described in section 2, B.Tech project is not an Institute requirement. However, some departments \nmay make it as the department requirement for the degree, and some might make it only as a compo-\nnent of the Honors requirement, whereas for Dual Degree, the project is a required component for the \naward of degree. As the case may be, the separate modes of assessment are mentioned hereunder. \n6.4.1    B.Tech. Project  \nB.Tech. Project may be offered as one unit as BTP, or two independent units as BTP -  I and BTP - II. \nWherever it is split into two units, BTP - II builds on BTP - I, and BTP - I becomes a pre- requisite for BTP \n– II. Departments may prescribe a minimum performance in BTP - I (which may be higher than the pass \ngrade ‘DD’) for being eligible for BTP - II. BTP - I and BTP - II are separately graded, at the end of the re-\nspective semesters. \nThese projects are supervised, and need regular interaction (at least once a week) with the supervisor. \nStudent has to submit a project report and defend it in front of a panel of examiners. The dates for sub-\nmission of reports, the dates for presentations, and details of mode of assessment are decided by the \nindividual departments.  \n6.4.2    Dual Degree Projects  \na) The following is the schedule for the DDP assessments: \na.i For evaluation of DDP stage-I, the student has to submit a report to the respective depart-\nment. Evaluation will be done, by a panel appointed by the DUGC/ coordinator, based on \nthe report and (a) either an across the table discussion and viva-voce or (b) seminar \npresentation. The panel shall consist of the supervisor(s) and atleast one more faculty \nmember, to act as examiners. \na.ii For evaluation of DDP stage-II, the student has to submit the reports to the respective de-\npartments on or before one week from the date specified in the Academic Calendar. The \nevaluation will be done by a Board of Examiners based on the report, and a viva-voce / \npresentation. Final Grade reports are to be sent by the Department to the Academic Sec-\ntion on completion of the viva-voce, as per the date specified in the Academic Calendar. \nb) The Board of Examiners for DDP assessment is approved by the Convener, DUGC, and will con-\nsist of the following: (Ref.: 159th & 191st Senate Meeting)  \nFor DDP Stage I  \ni Supervisor(s) \nii One Internal Examiner  \nFor DDP Stage (Final) II \nThe Final (II) stage assessment will be done by a Board of Examiners  appointed by the \nDPGC/IDPC consisting of the following: \ni Supervisor (s) \nii Internal Examiner \n26 iii External Examiner/Additional Internal Examiner in absence of  External Examiner, if \napproved by the Academic Unit/Department \niv Chairperson: A Professor/ Associate Professor from another academic unit or a dif-\nferent specialization/ research area. The Academic Unit may decide if a Chairperson \nis needed for the viva or if one of the Internal Examiners can also act as a Chairper-\nson. In case the Internal Examiner happens to be a Professor/ Associate Professor, \nhe may be designated to also serve as the Chairperson with prior approval of the \nConvener, DPGC.  \na.a Submission of Electronic form of Dissertation/ Report (Ref: 204th Senate Meeting) Dis-\nsertations/ Report needs to be submitted in electronic form to the Central Library. Due \nacademic approvals of the final version of the Dissertations/ Reports should be obtained \nfrom the supervisor(s) prior to finalizing the archival version of the Dissertation/ Report.  \nThe student shall submit the prescribed form for submission of dissertation/report to the \nacademic unit/Academic Office, duly signed by the concerned, within ONE month, from \nthe successful completion of the defence. If the copies of dissertation submitted after the \ndue date, a fine of Rs. 5000/- per month from the due date of submission till the date of \nsubmission will be levied. (Amended in the 207th Senate meeting). The final tran-\nscripts/provisional degree certificate/final degree certificate will be issued only after re-\nceipt of dissertations/reports. \na.b  The minimum passing grade in each stage of the project assessment shall be “ DD”. \na.c After registering for DDP (either of the stages), a student should not take up any other \nassignment (paid or unpaid) before submitting her/his dissertation. \na.d After the Dissertation is assessed, a hard bound copy of the final Dissertation along \nwith duly completed forms is to be submitted to the Academic office. Soft copies of \nthe Synopsis and the final Dissertation paper are to be submitted to the Central Li-\nbrary. \nThe project reports need to be submitted 7-15 days before the date of evaluation, but not earlier. \n6.4.3  B.S. Project (Ref: 240th Senate Meeting)  \nOn completion of the project, student is required to submit a report and make a presentation to a com-\nmittee appointed by the department which would award a letter grade.  \n \n6.4.4 Extension Rules for Projects (R&D, BTP, DDP, B.S. projects) (Ref. 236th Senate Meeting)  \nGrades for all registered project based courses have to be uploaded before the last date for grade sub-\nmission. The evaluation committee may recommend an II grade for unfinished work due to any reason. \nAlso, if a grade is not uploaded by the academic unit by the last date for grade submission, an II grade \nwill be automatically assigned to the student. \nIn the case of R&D projects, BTP-1, BTP-2, DDP-1 and the first stage of the four year B.S. project and the \n5 year integrated M.Sc project, a letter grade to replace the II grade must be submitted to the academic \noffice, at most 20 days after the last date for grade submission of the previous semester. If a letter \n27 grade is not received by the academic office in time, the II grade will be automatically converted to an \nFR.  No further extensions will be permitted on any grounds for these projects. The student may re-reg-\nister for the project (mandatory for DDP-1) in a subsequent semester in case an FR grade is assigned. \nFor the final stage of the B.S./M.Sc project and DDP-2, a letter grade to replace the ‘II’ grade must be \nsubmitted to the academic office at most 20 days after the last date for the grade submission. How-\never, the student may apply for an additional extension of at most 15 days (a final deadline of 35 days \nfrom the last date for grade submission of the previous semester), with recommendations and an ex-\nplanation for the delay by the guide, to the DUGC of the concerned academic unit.  Post assessment, \nthe grade may then be sent to the academic office through the Convener, DUGC before this date. After \nthis date (35 days from the last date for grade submission for project) the II grade will be automatically \nconverted to an FR grade. The student will then have to re-register for the course in the subsequent se-\nmester after payment of fees. No further extensions will be permitted on any grounds for these pro-\njects. \nThe decision on allotment of hostel rooms during such extensions is done independently by the Dean \n(S.A)'s office/HCU. \n \n6.5 Grading  \na) Indian Institute of Technology Bombay follows grading system. Based on the combined perfor-\nmance in all assessments, the student is awarded a letter grade in every course taken by \nhim/her in a particular semester as per the curriculum. These letter grades not only indicate a \nqualitative assessment of the student’s performance but also carry a quantitative (numeric) \nequivalent called the Grade Point. The letter grades and their equivalent grade point are given \nbelow: \nLetter \nGrade Grade Point \nAP  10 (Grade is awarded to students with exceptional performance) \nAA  10 \nAB   9 \nBB  8 \nBC 7 \nCC 6 \nCD  5 \nDD 4 \nFR 0 {Fail and repeat the course/ equivalent course for mandatory \ncourses (except core)} \nFF 0 (Fail & Re-examination) \n28 DX {Credits are not included in CPI. Attendance below 80% - Repeat the \ncourse for core course(s)/equivalent course for mandatory courses \n(except core)} \nW Course Withdrawn \nAU Satisfactory in an Audit course \nPP Passed \nNP Not Passed \nII Incomplete (place holder, gets converted to an appropriate grade af-\nter Semester end re-examination, as per applicability)  \nDR Dropped (DR is not a grade but only a position holder   indicating that \nthe course has been dropped and it has to be cleared in subsequent \nsemesters). \nA student passes the course if he/she gets any grade in the range of “AP” to “DD” (“AU” in the case of \nan audit course, but fails if he/she gets the grade “FR” and/or “DX”. ”FF”, “II” and “DR” are place hold-\ners.  \nb) The grade “AP” indicates exceptional performance and is awarded only in the Course/(s) in \nwhich the number of registered students is more than 50. It should not exceed 2 % of the total \nstrength of the particular theory or lab course. The grade “AP” is not awarded for projects / \nseminars. \nc) An “FR” grade is awarded in case/(s) where, in the opinion of the instructor (panel of examin-\ners in the case of projects), the performance of the student is below an acceptable threshold in \nthe in-semester and /or end-semester examinations.  It may also be awarded for Academic \nmalpractices. Details pertaining to Academic malpractices are available at: \nhttp://www.iitb.ac.in/newacadhome/punishments201521July .pdf  \nd) (Ref: 235th Senate Meeting)  ‘DX’ grade is awarded to students who have inadequate attend-\nance as per following: \nIIT Bombay expects one hundred percent (100 %) from its students in all  classes. If the at-\ntendance of the student, as counted with effect from the  first contact hour, falls below eighty \npercent of the total attendance expected, the instructor may award the student, ‘Drop due to \ninadequate attendance’, ‘DX’ grade in that course. This ‘Drop due to inadequate attendance’ \nGrade would, for the purpose of CPI calculation be treated as equivalent to a ‘Course Drop’ car-\nried out on initiation by the student. In calculating attendance, no specific concession is to be \ngiven for lack of attendance on Medical ground. Further, if a student has 80% attendance or \nmore, he/ she cannot be awarded ‘Drop due to inadequate attendance. Only exception to this \nrule is courses where the instructor has declared a prior in the first week that no DX grade will \nbe awarded. \ne) For a student present in the semester-end re-examination, the instructor will award a regular \nperformance grade (AP-FR) depending on the overall performance in the course including the \nre-examination.  \n29 f) There are, however, a few other academic requirements for the programmes. The following \ntwo grades viz., “PP” (Pass) and “NP” (Not pass), will be awarded for NCC/NSO/NSS. No grade \npoints are associated with these grades and performance in these courses is not taken into ac-\ncount in the calculation of the performance indices (SPI, CPI). However, the award of the de-\ngree is subject to obtaining a “PP” (Pass) grade in all such courses. A student will be awarded \n“PP” (Pass) / “NP” (Not Pass) grade for NCC/ NSO/NSS in each semester provided the minimum \nrequirement of these activities are met during that semester together with 80% minimum at-\ntendance, failing which the “NP” (Not Pass) grade will be awarded. \ng) (Ref: 239th Senate Meeting- effective from End Semester Examinations of the Spring Semes-\nter 2019-20).   \n“FF” grade can be awarded to UG students by the concerned course instructor.  The   students \nwill   be   given only  one   chance  for   re-examination   in   case   of   FF   grade, otherwise the \ngrade will be converted to FR.  Re-exam will be conducted for 50 % weightage (or same as the \nweightage of end-semester exam for the course).  Re-exam for students with FF grade will be \nconducted along with medical re-exam.  \nThe grade will be restricted to “DD” for the re-examination, in case of FF Grade. \nh) Course(s) completed by student(s) outside IIT Bombay by means of NPTEL and / or SWAYAM \nand / or Semester Exchange, following due approval of DUGC/ DPGC, will contribute only to-\nwards completion of credits. Grade(s) earned in such courses will not be considered for the \nSPI/ CPI calculation. The transcript will record such course(s) and the corresponding grade(s) as \nit is/ they are. (Applicable for NPTEL/ SWAYAM courses from the academic year 2020-2021 on-\nwards and for Semester exchange students for academic year 2021-22 onwards.) (Ref: 246th \nSenate Meeting)  \n \n6.6 Valid reasons for semester-end make-up examination (Ref: 240th Senate Meeting)  \nFollowing may be considered as valid reasons for semester – end make-up examination: \na) Serious illness/ accident in the case of the student herself/ himself. Serious illness/ accident/ \ndeath of parent/ guardian. \n6.7 Academic Malpractice  \nAcademic malpractices are severely dealt with. The details pertaining to Academic malpractices are \navailable at: http://www.iitb.ac.in/newacadhome/punishments201521July.pdf   \n \n \n6.8 SPI/CPI  \n6.8.1 Semester Performance Index (SPI)  \nThe performance of a student in a semester is indicated by a number called Semester Performance In-\ndex, SPI. The SPI is the weighted average of the grade points obtained in all the courses registered by \nthe student during the semester. For example, if a student passes five courses (Theory/labs. /Projects/ \n30 Seminar etc.) in a semester with credits C1, C2, C3, C4 and C5 and her/his grade points in these courses \nare g1, g2, g3, g4 and g5 respectively, then her/his SPI is equal to: \n C1g1 + C2 g2 + C3 g3 + C4 g4 + C5 g5 \nSPI =  ---------------------------------------------------------- \n C1 + C2 + C3 + C4 + C5 \nThe SPI is calculated to two decimal places. The SPI for any semester will take into consideration the FR \ngrades awarded in that semester. For example, if a student has failed in course 4, the SPI will then be \ncomputed as: \n C1g1 + C2 g2 + C3 g3 + C4 * ZERO+C5 g5 \nSPI =  ------------------------------------------------------------------- \n C1 + C2 + C3 + C4 + C5 \nThe courses which do not form the minimum requirement of the degrees will not be considered for cal-\nculation of the SPI. Such additional courses undertaken and the grades earned by the student will be \nshown separately. \nThe updated SPIs will be shown in the transcript only after the last date of grade submission (course + \nproject)  as per the Academic Calendar. Till then, only the SPI till previous completed semesters will be \ndisplayed. \n6.8.2    Cumulative Performance Index (CPI)  \nAn up to date assessment of the overall performance of a student from the time s/he entered the Insti-\ntute is obtained by calculating a number called the Cumulative Performance Index, CPI, in a manner \nsimilar to the calculation of SPI. The CPI therefore considers all the courses registered by the student, \ntowards the minimum requirement of the degree s/he has enrolled for, since s/he entered the Insti-\ntute. The CPI is calculated at the end of every semester to two decimal places. \nThe CPI will reflect the failed status in case of FR grade(s), till the course(s) is/are cleared.  \nWhen the course(s) is/are cleared by obtaining a pass grade on subsequent registration(s) the CPI will \nonly reflect the new grade and not the fail grades earned earlier. \nExample: Up to semester r a student has registered for n courses, among which s/he has a “FR” grade in \ncourse i. The semester grade report at the end of semester r therefore will contain a CPI calculated as: \nC1g1 + C2 g2 + C3 g3 + .. +Ci* ZERO+Cn gn \nCPI =  ------------------------------------------------------------------------- \nC1 + C2 + C3 + ... +Ci + ... + Cn \nEven if a student has failed in a course more than once, the course will figure only once in the numera-\ntor as well as the denominator. \nAt the end of semester r+1 s/he has registered for four more courses including the backlog course i and \nhas cleared all the courses including the backlog course, the CPI at the end of this semester is calculated \nas: \n31  C1g1 + C2 g2 + C3 g3 + .. +Ci*gi+..+Cn gn \nCPI =  -------------------------------------------------------------------- \n C1 + C2 + C3 + ... +Ci + ... + Cn \nThe courses which do not form the minimum requirement of the degrees will not be considered for cal-\nculation of the basic CPI. These courses will be shown separately. \nThe updated CPI will be shown in the transcript only after the last date of grade submission (course + \nproject) as per the Academic Calendar. Till then, only the CPI till previous completed semesters will be \ndisplayed. \nThe Transcript will reflect only two CPI i.e. a) CPI Courses and b) CPI – Courses +Project. (Ref: 241st   \nSenate Meeting)  \n6.8.3 Semester Grade Report  \nThe Senate of IIT Bombay in its 221st Meeting considered discontinuation of issue of Semester Grade \nCards from Spring Semester 2014-15. \nAll students are able to see their grades as soon as concerned Course instructor /Faculty member up-\nloads grades on the ASC. Students may use the data from their interface for the purpose of information \nand conveying to their parents as well. \n \n6.8.4 The Transcript: Consolidated Statement of Academic Performance  \nTranscript is a consolidated statement of a Academic Performance of a student for all the semesters \nsince joining the programme and is given to a student on successful completion of the programme \nalong with the degree certificate. For those students who have taken multiple attempts to clear a \ncourse, the transcript given on successful completion of the programme will record the entire history of \nthe academic performance of a student in all the courses he/she takes as a student in the Institute.  \nTherefore every course registered by a student and the grades obtained there upon (including FR,DX,W \netc.) will be mentioned in the transcript for the courses registered in the Autumn Semester 2016-17 on-\nwards. (Ref: 225th Senate Meeting) The transcript will reflect only two CPI i.e. a) CPI Courses and b) CPI- \nCourses + Project. (Ref: 241st  Senate Meeting)   Additional courses will be shown separately, indicating \nalso the minor / honors, if any, earned by the student. Additional copies of the transcript can be ob-\ntained if needed, on request and upon payment of applicable fee. \nStudents who have not yet completed the programme can obtain an Interim Transcript, if needed, on \nrequest and upon payment of applicable fee.  \n \n \n6.9  Display of In-Semester Performance \na) The in-semester performance of all students is communicated by the instructor to the students \nbefore the end-semester examination. Those awarded “DX” grades as described in 6.5 (d) \nabove will be clearly identified in this list. \n32 b) Based on the in-semester performance, the instructor may also decide and publish a cut-off \n(based on the average performance of the class), below which the in-semester performance is \nconsidered ‘Unsatisfactory’. This will be the basis on which an instructor may declare a “FR” \ngrade even when a student is absent for the end-semester examination on valid grounds. \n6. 10   Disclosing the Evaluated Answer scripts after Semester-End Examination  \nA course instructor will allow students to see the evaluated answer scripts before finalization of grades. \n6.11 Answer Script Retention period  \nEvaluated answer scripts are preserved by the Instructor/ Departmental Office for one semester. \n6.12 Compensatory time to PwD students (Ref: 239th Senate Meeting- effective from End Semes-\nter examination of the Autumn Semester 2019-20)  \nCompensatory time is to be provided to all PwD students across the Institute during written examina-\ntion. \nFor PwD Students, ‘compensatory time’ will not be less than 20 minutes per hour of examination for   \npersons   who   are   allowed   use   of   scribe/   reader/   lab   assistant.   All   the   candidates   with \nbenchmark   disability   not   availing   the   facility   of   scribe   may   be   allowed   additional   time   of \nminimum   of   one   hour   for   examination   of   3   hours   duration.   In   case   the   duration   of   the \nexamination is less than an hour, then the duration of additional time will be allowed on pro rata basis. \nAdditional time will not be less than 5 minutes and will be in the multiple of 5”. \nPwD students must inform the instructors in advance regarding their need for compensatory time dur-\ning examination.   \n \n7. Registration of NPTEL/ SWAYAM Courses:  \n(a) A student can take maximum of 12 credits of NPTEL/SWAYAM courses in lieu of departmental \nelective and Institute elective courses for the regular student (not under ARP), and, (b) a maximum of \n24 credits of NPTEL/SWAYAM courses in lieu of any courses including core courses for the students, \nwho are under ARP or in extension years after the approval from DUGC of the parent department to-\nwards the partial completion of mandatory academic curriculum. \n(b) A student can take NPTEL/SWAYAM courses as 'Additional Learning' for UG students subject to \nnot exceeding credit limit based on approval of DUGC. (Ref: 243rd Senate Meeting)  \n7.1 Credit Equivalence of NPTEL/SWAYAM courses with IIT Bombay courses (249th Senate Meeting):  \na) 12 Weeks NPTEL/SWAYAM courses would be typically considered equivalent to 6 credits at IIT \nBombay. However, in some special cases, DUGC/DPGC/UGC/PGC may consider and approve 12 \nweeks NPTEL/SWAYAM course(s) equivalent to 8 credits at IIT Bombay. \nb) 8 Weeks NPTEL/SWAYAM courses would be considered equivalent to 4 or 3 credits at IIT Bom-\nbay, depending on approval of DUGC/DPGC/UGC/PGC. \n7.2 Policy for registering/ award of grades for NPTEL/ SWAYAM/ Semester Exchange courses (Ref. \n251st Senate) \n33 i. Registration for NPTEL/ SWAYAM courses: Students may register for these courses during reg-\nistration window as per Academic calendar for that semester. Faculty Advisor can approve \nthese registrations in consultation with DUGC. \nii. Registration for Semester Exchange Courses: Academic Units may register students for these \ncourses as and when student returns from the FRN Institute, as per approval of DUGC. \niii. Grading- As per Academic calendar for that semester along with other courses. \niv. If no grades are allotted during the approved window, the course will be removed automati-\ncally from the registration of the students on the last date of Academic Activity, so that there \nwill be no issue in calculating SPI/CPI of the student. \n8 CHANGE OF BRANCH  \nBranch change rules are effective from Academic Year 2015-16 for students admitted \nthrough JEE.  \nStudents are eligible to apply for a change of branch/ programme after completing the first \ntwo semesters and before the start of the third semester.  \nA) The Eligibility Criteria for applying for a change of branch/ programme are: (Ref: 239th \nSenate Meeting – effective from Autumn semester 2020-21)  \na) Completion of the prescribed course credits in the first two semesters.  \nb) No FR/DX/DR/W grades at the end of the first two regular registered semesters.  \nc) NP grade in NOCS shall not be a bar for applying for a branch change (Ref: \n250thSenate Meeting).  \nd) NP grade in GC 101 shall not be a bar for applying for a branch change.  \ne) Students should secure an “eligibility-CPI” of at least 7.0. The “eligibility- CPI” is \ncalculated taking into account only the following 1st year courses:  (Ref: 254th Senate \nMeeting).  \ni. Introduction to HASMED (4 + 4 = 8 Credits)  \nii. DIC-1 (6 Credits)  \niii. DIC-2 (6 Credits)  \niv. Makerspace (MS 101 = 8 Credits)  \nv. Physics Lab (PH 117 = 3 Credits)  \n34 vi. Chemistry Lab (CH 117 = 3 Credits)  \nB) The calculation of CPI for “Change of Branch”, henceforth referred to as the “Branch-\nChange-CPI”, will be based only on grades obtained in the following 1st year theory \ncourses: (Ref: 254th Senate Meeting).  \na) Physics: two half-semester courses {(PH 111 and PH 112) = 8 credits}  \nb) Chemistry: two half-semester courses {(CH 105 and CH 107) = 8 credits}  \nc) Mathematics: four half-semester courses {(MA 106, MA 108, MA 109, MA 111) = \n16 credits}  \nd) Biology (BB 101 = 6 credits)  \ne) Computer Programming and Utilization (CS 101 = 6 credits)  \nC)  a) Before beginning the allocation, additional seats are made available in each \n branch, limited to a maximum of 10% of its sanctioned strength.  \nb) While students are allotted seats of general and reserved type during  admission, this \ndata is not used during branch change. Each available seat  may be occupied by students of \nany category.  \nD) An eligible student's request for a shift from branch A to branch B will be considered \nvalid if any one of the following two sets of criteria are satisfied.  \n Set 1  \ni the “Branch-Change-CPI” of the student is at least 9  \nii there is a seat available in Branch B  \n Set 2  \ni. There is a seat available in Branch B.  \nii. The strength in branch A, from which a change is being sought, does not \nfall below its sanctioned strength by more than 25%.  \niii. There is no student with either (I) higher “Branch-Change-CPI” or (II) \nsame “Branch-Change-CPI” and higher “overall-CPI” who is currently \nbeing denied a change from any other branch X to branch B due to the \n35 strength of branch X falling below its sanctioned strength by more than \n25% due to rule (ii).  \n Procedure  \nAmong all valid requests, students with the highest “Branch-Change-CPI” are  considered \nfor shifting first.  \nIn case more than one student has the same “Branch-Change-CPI” then the  “overall-\nCPI” will be used to break ties and a student among the above with  the highest “over-\nall-CPI” will be shifted.  \nIn case there is a tie for both the “Branch-Change-CPI” and the “overall- CPI”, then the fol-\nlowing will apply:  \nIf a student with “Branch-Change-CPI” x and “overall-CPI” y is shifted from branch \nA to branch B then every student with “Branch-Change-CPI” x and “overall-CPI” y \nwith a request for branch B will be shifted to branch B, even if their request violates \n(ii) above. If necessary, extra seats will be created to accommodate them.  \nShifts as above are performed as long as there are valid requests.  \nE) All changes of branch can be effected only once at the beginning of the second academic \nyear. No application for change of branch during the subsequent academic years will be en-\ntertained.  \nF) Branch change decisions will be final and will not be reversed (Ref: 250th Senate Meet-\ning). \n \n"}

Tech. Level Research Project. \nURA03: for Dual Degree Level Research Project \nURA01: This is a recognition of a small research/ developmental effort, successfully completed by a stu-\ndent in the first, second or third year of an undergraduate programme – that is, a B.Tech., B.S. or a Dual \nDegree Programme. A faculty member must agree to supervise the student for the URA01 project. The \nstudent works with this faculty member, with the approval of the DUGC, for four-to-six month duration \n– including the summer or winter vacations. No formal registration is required with the academic office \nat this stage. If the faculty member is satisfied with the quantum and quality of work done, at any \nstage, s/he may recommend the award of URA01 to the student, which will then be listed in the tran-\nscript of the student in the semester immediately following the semester in which this award was rec-\nommended.
